Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy moon. Then the lazy moon drank some coffee and started chasing the quick brown fox, who was marauding around the country while all the good men were sleeping off an overdose of bourbon. 

The bourbon came from Kentucky, home of blue grass, sour mash and fast horses.

Eventually one of the good men shook off his hangover, jumped on a fast horse and began chasing the erstwhile lazy, now fully caffeinated moon and the quick brown fox.

This is how fox hunting began
